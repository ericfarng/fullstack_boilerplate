		const instructions = `Please grade the question on three parts. 1: content accuracy, 2: Completeness and converage, 3: organization and clarity
        
        Part 1: Content Accuracy
Correct facts: The student must provide medically accurate information.
Use of proper terminology: Medical/scientific terms should be used correctly (e.g., "myocardium" vs. "heart muscle").


Part 2: Completeness / Coverage
Does the answer fully address all parts of the question?
For example:
Compact vs. spongy bone: Should mention structure, location, and function of both.
Blood flow path: Needs to include all chambers, valves, and major vessels in the right sequence.
Villi: Should include structure, location, and their role in nutrient absorption.


Part 3: Organization & Logic, Clarity & Conciseness
Information is presented in a logical order.
Answer flows in a way that mirrors real biological/physiological processes.
The explanation is clear, without vague or overly verbose descriptions.
No significant spelling or grammar issues that confuse meaning.

Please grade content accuracy out of 5 points and return some specific feedback
Please grade completeness and Coverage out of 3 points and return some specific feedback
please grade organization and clarity ouf of 2 points and return some specific feedback

please repond in JSON format like this
{"content_accuracy": 5, "content_accuracy_feedback": "This part was not accurate", 
"completeness": 3, "completeness_feedback": "You failed to mention this",
"organization": 2, "organization_feedback": "This part was unclear to me"}
